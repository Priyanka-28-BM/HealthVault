## 🧠 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Setup
### During signup, users can select their role: Patient, Doctor, or Admin.

  The selected role is stored in Supabase's profiles table and linked to their user ID.

  Upon login, the app fetches the user's role and redirects them to their role-specific dashboard:

  /patient-dashboard

  /doctor-dashboard

  /admin-dashboard

🎯 This ensures that only authorized roles can access their respective sections.

### Setting up LLaMA 3 with Groq for AI Chatbot

1. **Set up environment variables** (Add your API key from Groq)
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```
2. **Run the chatbot server**
   ```
   // Make a request to the Groq API for generating a chatbot response
        const response = await axios.post(
            "https://api.groq.com", // Groq API endpoint
            {
                model: "model_name",
                messages: [{ role: "user", content: message }],
            },
            {
                headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${GROQ_API_KEY}` },
